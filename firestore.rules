/**
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for all user-generated
 * content, ensuring that private data like orders remains confidential. The core
 * philosophy is that users can only access data located within their own
 * user document tree.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: A user's profile document. The root of their private data.
 * - /users/{userId}/orders/{orderId}: A user's specific order history, nested
 *   to inherit ownership rules directly from the path.
 * - /users/{userId}/orders/{orderId}/orderItems/{orderItemId}: The items
 *   within a specific order.
 * - /curtains/{curtainId}: A top-level collection for the public product
 *   catalog, readable by everyone.
 * - /contactFormSubmissions/{contactFormSubmissionId}: A write-only collection
 *   for public contact form submissions.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User Isolation: The rules are primarily based on the `{userId}` wildcard
 *   in the path. This provides a simple, performant, and secure way to guarantee
 *   that users can only see their own data, directly fulfilling the user's
 *   request: "I want only me to see my orders, not anyone else."
 * - No User Listing: It is not possible for any client to list all documents
 *   in the `/users` collection, preventing user enumeration attacks.
 * - Denormalization for Authorization: The data structure is designed to avoid
 *   costly `get()` calls in rules. By nesting `orders` under `users`, the
 *   ownership is implied by the path itself. On creation, documents must contain
 *   an internal ID that matches the ID from the path to ensure relational integrity.
 * - Public vs. Private Data: Data is segregated by collection. Private data is
 *   nested under `/users/{userId}`, while public data like the product catalog
 *   (`/curtains`) is in a separate top-level collection. This is more secure and
 *   performant than filtering a single collection with a boolean flag.
